      Most modern Burmese are descendants of one female cat called Wong Mau,
      which was brought from Burma to America in 1930 and bred with American
      Siamese. From there, American and British breeders developed distinctly
      different Burmese breed standards, which is unusual among pedigreed
      domestic cats. Most modern cat registries do not formally recognize the
      two as separate breeds, but those that do refer to the British type as the
      European Burmese.
